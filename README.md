### Tech Stack

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - We used React Native to create the frontend with the help of the Expo framework.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - We used Realtime Database to hold the data from all the historical markers. For users, we used Firebase Authentication and to hold user data we used Firestore.
- [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-maps) - We used react-native-maps for displaying markers around the user.
